# Abstract

The project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for extracting essential information from Aadhar cards. The system will process Aadhar card images, employing preprocessing techniques and advanced OCR technology to accurately recognize and extract key details, including the individual's name, Aadhar number, date of birth, address, and other relevant information. The solution prioritizes data privacy and security, adhering to legal and ethical standards. Optionally, a user-friendly interface may be provided for manual verification or correction of extracted data. The goal is to create a reliable, scalable, and compliant system that streamlines the extraction of Aadhar card information for various applications.
